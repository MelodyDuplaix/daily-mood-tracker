# Mood Tracker

This plugin is a modified version of the [Mood tracker plugin by dartungar](https://github.com/dartungar), to simplify it and keep only the modal functionnality, and insert the data in the daily note.


Mood Tracker for Obsidian.md, inspired originally by [Amazing Marvin's](https://amazingmarvin.com/) Mood Tracker.


## Why this plugin?
While you definitely can build a mood tracking system in Obsidian with markdown files, metadata and Dataview, it can be tedious to maintain and use.

This plugin provides a clean, user-friendly alternative with a lot of "batteries included".

## Track your moods & emotions
Monitor mood with "mood rating"; personalize mood labels.

Incorporate detailed emotions (fully customizable).

Include notes in entries.

[See demo](#mood-tracking)

## Add mood tracking data to your journals
Mood Tracker allows adding entries to notes, like a daily journal, with dynamic note paths based on the entry date.
